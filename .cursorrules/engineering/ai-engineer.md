# ðŸ¤– AI Engineer Role & Responsibilities

## AI Integration Checklist

### 1. Model Selection & Setup
- [ ] Question model requirements thoroughly:
  - [ ] "What specific capabilities does this use case require?"
  - [ ] "What is our maximum acceptable latency?"
  - [ ] "What is our budget per 1000 tokens?"
  - [ ] "Do we need streaming capabilities?"
  - [ ] "What failover options do we need?"
- [ ] Validate API setup with key questions:
  - [ ] "Are all credentials properly secured?"
  - [ ] "Have we tested all error scenarios?"
  - [ ] "What monitoring metrics are critical?"
  - [ ] "What alerts should be in place?"

### 2. Prompt Engineering
- [ ] Validate prompt design with questions:
  - [ ] "Is the instruction clear and unambiguous?"
  - [ ] "What edge cases might we encounter?"
  - [ ] "How do we handle unexpected responses?"
  - [ ] "Are our examples diverse enough?"
  - [ ] "What validation criteria must responses meet?"
- [ ] Document prompt patterns by asking:
  - [ ] "Can another engineer replicate this?"
  - [ ] "Are all parameters clearly explained?"
  - [ ] "What testing has validated this prompt?"

### 3. Mistral Integration (HuggingFace)
- [ ] Question model deployment needs:
  - [ ] "What hardware requirements do we have?"
  - [ ] "How much cache storage is needed?"
  - [ ] "What batch sizes optimize performance?"
  - [ ] "What are our memory constraints?"
  - [ ] "How do we handle model updates?"

### 4. OpenAI Integration
- [ ] Validate integration requirements:
  - [ ] "What's our maximum concurrent request load?"
  - [ ] "How do we handle rate limit errors?"
  - [ ] "What's our fallback strategy?"
  - [ ] "How do we track costs per feature?"
  - [ ] "What response times are acceptable?"

### 5. Response Processing
- [ ] Verify processing requirements:
  - [ ] "What schema validation is needed?"
  - [ ] "How do we handle malformed responses?"
  - [ ] "What caching strategy is most effective?"
  - [ ] "How do we version response formats?"
  - [ ] "What metrics indicate success?"

## Best Practices for AI Engineering Excellence

### Performance Optimization
- Question each optimization:
  - "What's the performance impact?"
  - "Is this optimization worth the complexity?"
  - "Have we benchmarked alternatives?"
  - "What's our target response time?"

### Reliability & Resilience
- Validate reliability measures:
  - "What's our target uptime?"
  - "How quickly must we recover from failures?"
  - "What's our backup strategy?"
  - "How do we monitor system health?"

### Cost Management
- Question cost efficiency:
  - "What's our budget per feature?"
  - "Can we use a simpler model?"
  - "What's our caching ROI?"
  - "How do we identify waste?"

### Security & Privacy
- Verify security measures:
  - "What data are we exposing?"
  - "How do we protect user inputs?"
  - "What security audits are needed?"
  - "How do we handle sensitive data?"

### Quality Assurance
- Validate quality processes:
  - "What defines high-quality responses?"
  - "How do we measure accuracy?"
  - "What testing coverage do we need?"
  - "How often should we review performance?"
