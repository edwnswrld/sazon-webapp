# üìä Project Management Guidelines for Cursor

## Project Management Checklist

### 1. Scope Clarification & Validation
- [ ] Ask key clarifying questions:
  - [ ] "What specific problem are we solving?"
  - [ ] "Who are the primary stakeholders?"
  - [ ] "What defines project success?"
  - [ ] "What are our constraints (time, budget, resources)?"
  - [ ] "What are potential risks we should consider?"
- [ ] Document all assumptions and get stakeholder confirmation
- [ ] Create scope statement and get written approval
- [ ] Identify what's explicitly OUT of scope
- [ ] Establish change request process

### 2. Task Organization & Clarity
- [ ] For each task, verify clarity with questions:
  - [ ] "What does 'done' look like?"
  - [ ] "Who is responsible for this?"
  - [ ] "What dependencies exist?"
  - [ ] "What could go wrong?"
  - [ ] "Do we have all required resources?"
- [ ] Review task hierarchy and sub-tasks
- [ ] Validate task descriptions are actionable

### 3. Timeline & Milestone Validation
- [ ] Question each deadline:
  - [ ] "Is this timeline realistic?"
  - [ ] "What buffer should we include?"
  - [ ] "Have we accounted for dependencies?"
- [ ] Track phase completion status
- [ ] Identify and document potential bottlenecks

### 4. Resource & Capacity Planning
- [ ] Validate team capacity with questions:
  - [ ] "Do we have the right skills available?"
  - [ ] "What is the current workload?"
  - [ ] "Are there competing priorities?"
- [ ] Document skill requirements per task
- [ ] Flag potential resource constraints

## Best Practices for Scope Management

### Requirements Gathering
- Ask "Why?" five times for each requirement
- Document user stories with acceptance criteria
- Get stakeholder sign-off on requirements
- Create detailed technical specifications
- Validate feasibility with technical team

### Status Tracking
- ‚úÖ = Verified and Completed
- [ ] = Not Started
- üöß = In Progress (with % complete)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è = Blocked (with reason)
- üîÑ = In Review

### Priority Assessment Questions
- P0: "Will the project fail without this?"
- P1: "Is this critical for core functionality?"
- P2: "Does this significantly impact user experience?"
- P3: "Is this important but not urgent?"
- P4: "Would this be nice to have?"

### Phase Gate Questions
- "Have we met all entry criteria?"
- "Are all deliverables complete?"
- "Have stakeholders approved?"
- "Are there any open issues?"
- "Is documentation complete?"

## Scope Control Guidelines

### Scope Inclusion Criteria
- Validate with questions:
  - "Does this align with project goals?"
  - "Can we deliver with current resources?"
  - "Is this technically feasible?"
  - "What's the ROI?"
  - "Have we considered alternatives?"

### Scope Exclusion Criteria
- Question potential scope creep:
  - "Is this essential for MVP?"
  - "What happens if we don't do this?"
  - "Can this wait for a future phase?"
  - "What's the impact on timeline/budget?"
  - "Do benefits justify the changes?"

Remember: 95% confidence comes from thorough questioning and documentation. Never assume understanding - verify through clear communication and written confirmation.

## üéØ **Saz√≥n Project Scope Validation**

### **Validated Scope Boundaries**
- **IN SCOPE (MVP):** 3-day meal plan generation, grocery list creation, dietary restriction filtering
- **OUT OF SCOPE:** Weekly/monthly planning, Instacart integration (Phase 2), expensive cloud services
- **CONSTRAINTS:** Solo developer, budget limitations, no GPU usage, free tier services only

### **Resource Allocation Confirmed**
- **Team:** Solo developer with full-stack capabilities
- **Budget:** Free tier services (Supabase, Vercel, Render)
- **Timeline:** MVP-focused development with clear phase gates
- **Dependencies:** AI provider APIs, community feedback for validation

### **Risk Mitigation Strategy**
- **Technical Risks:** AI API costs, prompt engineering complexity
- **Business Risks:** User adoption, competition from established apps
- **Resource Risks:** Solo developer burnout, scope creep
- **Mitigation:** Clear MVP scope, community validation, phased development

### **Success Criteria Validation**
- **MVP Success:** Functional meal plan generation with grocery lists
- **User Success:** Reduced meal planning stress, fresh grocery utilization
- **Business Success:** User retention, community engagement, organic growth
